          <p>Growing up, my parents always wanted me to learn new things, make new experiences, and grow through them. Starting with karate, piano, and dance, they really
            placed emphasis on learning new skills and developing new passions, which they felt was a good way to develop one's character and bring the best out of their 
            personalities. I became used to learning in the more traditional sense, which was learning by example. It wasn't until I started learning swimming did I discover, 
            a new way of learning. Things weren't working out as I had a fear of the water. My teacher seemed to have an idea in mind, and took me to the deep end of the pool. 
            I was told to stand in position right on the edge of the pool and close my eyes. Within seconds I felt a push and my 10 year old self had fallen into the deep end of the pool. 
            Remarkably, I swam up to the surface and my fear of the water was gone. After this lesson, I realized that sometimes to learn something one must dive straight in regardless of 
            doubt or thought. This proved useful in the future, as there were times when I started becoming interested in something and wanted to learn, but was hesistant due to doubt or 
            a steep learning curve, but using the mentality of just going for it has proved to be a great piece of advice I will continue to remember.
